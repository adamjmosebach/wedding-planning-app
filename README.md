## Project Planning

<br>

### Overview

**Vendor Connector** is an easy-to-use app whereby a person who is considering a wedding vendor can connect with people who have already used that vendor. They can hopefullly then gain more insight and make a more informed decision on whether on not to use them on their special day.

The **Vendor Connector**'s goal is simple: connect someone planning an event to those who have done it already: make them more informed about who they choose as vendors.

#### Goals

A user should be able to:
- Create a review for each of their vendors
- Be able to browse vendor reviews
- Be able to connect with the person who made the review
